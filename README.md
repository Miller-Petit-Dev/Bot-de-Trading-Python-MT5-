## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains an **AI-augmented automated trading and decision system** developed in Python and integrated with **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.

This project is not a simple trading bot.  
It is a **modular, data-driven system** designed to automate market analysis, strategy evaluation, risk management, and trade execution using quantitative rules.

The system reflects my approach as a **Software Engineer focused on solving complex problems through automation, system design, and intelligent tooling**.

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Development Approach

Artificial Intelligence is used as a **development accelerator and decision-support tool**, allowing:

- Rapid iteration on strategies and system logic  
- Faster adaptation to new rules, assets, and conditions  
- Code optimization and refactoring  
- Multi-technology and language-agnostic execution  

This approach enables efficient delivery without compromising engineering quality or best practices.
